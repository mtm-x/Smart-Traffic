# Ambulance Detection Using openCV 
  Enables green light and navigation to nearest hospital

## Introduction
  Pre Trained the model with 4000+ ambulance images with YoloV5 for ambulance detection. For this setup we used the IP camera of mobile using droid cam app. This python script will detect the ambulance with confident>0.80(probability) and send the ssh command to raspberry pi to turn ON the green light.
